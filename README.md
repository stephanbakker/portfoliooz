remove flickr credentials from git, into environment stuff
split flickr authenticate into service, now different in page and pages
write tests
use jscs/eslint
look at webpack, wtf is it doing

responsive
make sure images are never too big for the screen
decide on retina, image data is available
add mobile device-width stuff etc
look at google images, zooming in and out quite smoothly on mobile
